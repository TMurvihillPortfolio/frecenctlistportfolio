# TODO

- frecency not entering correctly on add
- implement error messages
- frecency calc does not work when you change the dates, frecency order goes wacky
- if you add an item with no click, 00-00-00 date wrecks calculation

### Low Priority
- after delete, scroll to location of where deleted item was
- make id fields in db unique

### FUTURE FEATURES !!

- up/down arrows to adjust quantities with possible increment field
- allow user to adjust frecency periord, currently 100 days
