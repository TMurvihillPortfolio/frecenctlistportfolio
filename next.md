# WHAT TO DO NEXT

- why isn't list stay disappearred when edit item clicked
- get frecency to work correctly in editItem
- get frecency to work correctly in addItem (might be ok already)
- remove frecency field, make it only by calculation 
- change expected clicks for 'often' to once per day to once per days, i.e 20 clickes per 100 days
